### Rough basic starting point ###

Scripts here rely on building a local archive of strava activities.  Strava has a rate limit so better to pull once and store.  
For now it uses json and just creates a ridiculous long line.   

config.yaml should be filled with strava api details.  There are websites that detail how to do this. 

 
#### TODO ####

Build simple config.yaml generator to simplify setup

Place checks in plotting scripts to update/build the archive when needed
